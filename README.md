# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project
Ashley Trocle's Final Project Repo

Using data from the NHANES, ASC, OpenDataPhilly, this project sought to understand the relationship between lead exposure and various demographic, socioeconomic and neighborhood characteristics.

The project integrates social epidemiology, environmental health, public health and policy analysis to address the complex nature of issues that contribute to lead exposure and the significant impact it can have on children.

The data files used in this project are appropriately linked within the documents.
