# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

### **Ashley Trocle's Final Project Repo**

Using data from the NHANES, ASC, OpenDataPhilly, and the EPA, this project sought to understand the relationship between lead exposure and various demographic, socioeconomic and neighborhood characteristics. The goal of the project is to understand areas to target policy interventions in Philadelphia.

The project integrates social epidemiology, environmental health, public health and policy analysis to address the complex nature of issues that contribute to lead exposure and the significant impact it can have on children.

-   NHANES: National lead blood lead levels in children

-   OpenDataPhilly: Local level blood lead levels in children

-   ACS: Used to understand housing stock as it related to lead paint bans and policies for rental properties

-   EPA's Environmental Justice Index: Used to understand where lead paint remediation might be targeted in Philadelphia
